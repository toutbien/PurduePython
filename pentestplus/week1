#Week 1 Studdies for Section 1.3 of Pentest+003

Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM) 
The OSSTMM [Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual]- Developed by ISECOM [institute for security and open methodologies] is a methodology to test the operational security of physical locations, human interactions, and all forms of communications such as wireless, wired, analogue, and digital.

Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) 
The Penetration Testing Execution Standard  started in 2009 by information security consultants attempting to address deficiencies in the penetration testing community consists of seven (7) main sections.

    Pre-engagement Interactions
    Intelligence Gathering
    Threat Modeling
    Vulnerability Analysis
    Exploitation
    Post Exploitation
    Reporting

MITRE ATT&CK 
A knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.

Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 
The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.

OWASP Mobile Application SecurityVerification Standard (MASVS) 
The OWASP MASVS (Mobile Application Security Verification Standard) is the industry standard for mobile app security.

Purdue model 
The Purdue model is a structural model for industrial control system (ICS) security that concerns segmentation of physical processes, sensors, supervisory controls, operations, and logistics. Long regarded as a key framework for ICS network segmentation to protect operational technology (OT) from malware and other attacks, the model persists alongside the rise of edge computing and direct-to-cloud connectivity.

Threat modeling frameworks
Threat Modeling is a proactive, holistic approach of analyzing potential threats and risks in a system or application to identify and address them proactively. It involves analyzing how an attacker might try to exploit weaknesses in the system and then taking steps to mitigate those risks.

DREAD
The DREAD model quantitatively assesses the severity of a cyberthreat using a scaled rating system that assigns numerical values to risk categories. The DREAD model has five categories (Meier et al., 2003):

    Damage: Understand the potential damage a particular threat is capable of causing.
    Reproducibility: Identify how easy it is to replicate an attack.
    Exploitability: Analyze the systemâ€™s vulnerabilities to ascertain susceptibility to cyberattacks.
    Affected Users: Calculate how many users would be affected by a cyberattack.
    Discoverability: Determine how easy it is to discover vulnerable points in the system infrastructure.

STRIDE
STRIDE is an acronym for six threat categories: Spoofing identity, Tampering with data, Repudiation threats, Information disclosure, Denial of service and Elevation of privileges. Two Microsoft engineers, Loren Kohnfelder and Praerit Garg, developed STRIDE in the late 1990s

OCTAVE
The Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE) is a framework for identifying and managing information security risks. It defines a comprehensive evaluation method that allows an organization to identify the information assets that are important to the mission of the organization, the threats to those assets, and the vulnerabilities that may expose those assets to the threats
