#Week 4 is a massive information load around attacks and exploits

//  4.1  Given a scenario, analyze output to prioritize and prepare attacks.	
	Target prioritization
	High-value asset identification 
	Target Descriptors and metrics 
 
	Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score https://www.first.org/cvss/
        The CVSS scoring consists of the exploitability and impact of an issue. The exploitability measurements consist of access vector, access complexity, and authentication. The impact metrics consist of the CIA triad, including confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
	Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) 
	Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) 
	Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) 
 
	End-of-life software/systems 
	Default configurations 
	Running services 
	Vulnerable encryption methods
	Defensive capabilities
	Capability selection

 
	Attack preparation Tool selection
