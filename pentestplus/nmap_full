TCP Flag Headers:

    URG: Urgent flag indicates that the urgent pointer filed is significant. The urgent pointer indicates that the incoming data is urgent, and that a TCP segment with the URG flag set is processed immediately without consideration of having to wait on previously sent TCP segments.
    ACK: Acknowledgement flag indicates that the acknowledgement number is significant. It is used to acknowledge the receipt of a TCP segment.
    PSH: Push flag asking TCP to pass the data to the application promptly.
    RST: Reset flag is used to reset the connection. Another device, such as a firewall, might send it to tear a TCP connection. This flag is also used when data is sent to a host and there is no service on the receiving end to answer.
    SYN: Synchronize flag is used to initiate a TCP 3-way handshake and synchronize sequence numbers with the other host. The sequence number should be set randomly during TCP connection establishment.
    FIN: The sender has no more data to send.

By default, Nmap will attempt to connect to the 1000 most common ports. A closed TCP port responds to a SYN packet with RST/ACK to indicate that it is not open. This pattern will repeat for all the closed ports as we attempt to initiate a TCP 3-way handshake with them.

sT - TCP Scan
sU - UDP scan
-p- -  scan all 65535 ports
r - fixes the order of scans which can be helpful to test upon bootup
F - fast mode, decreases the number of scanned ports from 1000 to 100 most common ports.
sS - stealth scan:
the default scan mode is SYN scan, and it requires a privileged (root or sudoer) user to run it. 
SYN scan does not need to complete the TCP 3-way handshake; instead, it tears down the connection once it receives a response from the server. 
Because we didnâ€™t establish a TCP connection, this decreases the chances of the scan being logged

Scanning ime
You can control the scan timing using -T<0-5>. -T0 is the slowest (paranoid), while -T5 is the fastest. According to Nmap manual page, there are six templates:

    paranoid (0)
    sneaky (1)
    polite (2)
    normal (3)
    aggressive (4)
    insane (5)

Sending # packes per second
For example, --max-rate 10 or --max-rate=10 ensures that your scanner is not sending more than ten packets per second.
